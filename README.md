# HSBA-
HSBA Final Project
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the HSBA Final Project. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for preprocessing, transforming, and modeling data. It incorporates feature engineering, encoding, scaling, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning model training.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning pipeline. It includes handling raw data, preparing it for modeling, and training a predictive model using best practices in data science.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Combines categorical and numerical features for model optimization.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to streamline features while retaining essential variance.
Model Training: Implements machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Custom Workflow: Integrates preprocessing and modeling steps into a seamless pipeline.
